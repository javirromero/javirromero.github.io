    <div id="about">

      <p>I am a Chilean visual artist and self taught musician and I was born on October 2nd, 1989 in Coquimbo, Chile.

      <p>My work is mainly autobiographical, with a big emphasis on my father’s death when I was 16 years old and my childhood in Andacollo, a little gold miners’ town located at the south of Coquimbo. I lived there until I was 6 years old.</p>

      <p>Regarding painting, I like to use cheap and recycled materials to make my visual pieces. In them I used a variety of material such as pens, color pencils, acrylics, markers, cardboard, pieces of my old diaries and verses of my own songs.</p>

      <p>Visual art is only one part of my work since I’m also involved in music. I’m the lead singer and guitarist of Va la paloma, a psychedelic rock duo based in Santiago de Chile which has influences from grunge, noise and shoegaze; also, I play with OENO, a duo that explores noise and ambient music. With Va la paloma we use a very modern system of sound reactive visuals, triggered by our guitars. With OENO we merge performance art with noise music, doing shows that disorient the audience by deconstructing their expectations and embracing bizarre visual art and expressive body language.</p>

      <p>Nowadays, I am exploring with software such as Ableton Live, Audition, Logic X, p5 and Illustrator to expand my skills into multimedia experiences.</p>
